This repo contains my writeup and all of the resources necessary to complete the 2023 Magnet Forensics User Summit Virtual CTF.

##Folder Structure

You can find all of the images necessary for playing along with the Cipher section of the CTF in the ``Crypto resources`` directory under ``resources``.

In the same way, you can find an executable of ALEAPP in the ``Forensics Resources`` directory of my resources.

## Additional Notes

You can get a free trial of Magnet Axiom here https://www.magnetforensics.com/products/magnet-axiom/

To work with the image on your own, get it here: https://go.magnetforensics.com/e/52162/L20Logical20Image20-20Data-tar/lhwp55/1349654479?h=khD041z2f6G7MYqLCQrfKcp2-yHyrjShX0ToeHbrFMo. The image is downloaded as a ``.tar`` file. Process that as normal in ALEAPP, normal in Axiom, and as a logical file in Autopsy.

Refer to ``questions.txt`` to just have the questions if you'd like to play them before reading my writeup.
